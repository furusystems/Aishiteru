OpenFL gamedev tools.

These are tools originally written in AIR/AS3 built expressly for our OpenFL game engine, which renders exclusively using graphics.drawTiles and graphics.drawTriangles.

They include 

- Compilation of textures
- Building optimized animation data from sprite sheets
- Creation of linearly interpolated point-to-point motion paths
- Creation of FK based bone animations for larger characters
  
The goal is to port the tools to Haxe3, optimize and improve on the workflow, unification of the whole bunch into a single application, and supporting project files and automated project structure management.

Additionally, libraries will be formalized to allow this renderer to be used for other game engines.
